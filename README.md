# unraid-powershell
This is an Unraid plugin for Microsoft PowerShell (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

This will require you to re-install it after every reboot. I'm unsure on how to install it otherwise.

The install is performed, basically, exactly as described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1#linux

It probably needs some improvement.

Version will be lock step with the PowerShell stable version
