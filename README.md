# unraid-powershell
This is an Unraid plugin for Microsoft PowerShell (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

This will require you to re-install it after every reboot. I'm unsure on how to install it otherwise.

It just simply removes old dirs, downloads the new source, and untars the files.

It probably needs some improvement.

Version will be lock step with the PowerShell stable version
